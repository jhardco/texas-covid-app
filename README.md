I know, I *know*...

These types of apps have been the biggest fad in data analysis since mid March and what's the point of making one now? Aren't we over it by now? 

Probably. 

But, this one is mine and I like it. So many dashboards I've seen have used the now ubiquitous ArcGIS-based black on black dashboard. Think the Johns-Hopkins that everbody has seen. These are undoubtedly great tools and are excellent at displaying large amounts of data in a *mostly* easy to understand way. 

I made this app to help push through all the busyness of the aforementioned dashboards in favor of something if not as equally aesthetically pleasing, at least a bit easier to comprehend with less things to cl;ick on and way fewer subplots. 

I plan on continually maintining and updating the visualizations and adding new analysis as different data streams are availble (or known to me).
